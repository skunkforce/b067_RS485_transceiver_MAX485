# sanity check
## setup
Connect a 5V power source to J1 pins 1 and 10. 
1. Verify that something between 1ma and 100ma is consumed
2. Verfiy that A and B (pins 2 and 3 of J2) are driven at least 2V appeart.

# communication sheck
## setup
Connect two b067 to each other (A pin to A pin, B pin to B pin and GND to GND) and to two different UARTs (two osf.b018 boards for example). Write a simple program to send two bytes from board one to board two and another small program which reacts to input by sending a responce.
